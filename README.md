# Site Selection Concept

An experimental playground used primarily to test out a few items from the [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) (and larger) community that have peaked my curiosity.

### Primary Tools to Test

* [**React Motion**](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion) - an animation library that uses a physics spring abstraction.
* [**Radium**](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium) - a library used to help apply inline styles on components.
* [**Babel**](https://babeljs.io/) - allows for a variety of the ES2015 features to be used today.
* [**Webpack**](http://webpack.github.io/) - module bundler.

### Demo Project

* [Example Video](https://vine.co/v/eXpzxLMB1HE)
* [Live Demo](https://fathomless-thicket-6069.herokuapp.com/)

The project or demo in this particular case is a "site selection" concept or basically any sidebar that changes context based on a primary attribute. A few UI goals for that particular demo were:

* **Quick** - make the overall experience of trying to find the site your looking fast.
* **Context (before & after)** - using animation, provide a bit more context for the site you just selected and reinforce that choice.
* **Entrance & Exit** - provide a consistent entry and exit point to the site switcher so that you can cancel the operation by clicking the same spot you used to enter the operation.

It is primarily focused around the site selection process and as such, the "links" below selected site area are just for show.

### Disclaimer

This is still very experimental and the project was created mainly as a local test bed for using the tools mentioned above. Learning the "ins and outs" of those tools and evaluating their ease of use / usefulness were the primary goals for this project. The source code is certainly not intended for production use.

Basically a long-winded way of saying:

> Please excuse the mess, still learning :)

**P.S.** Try typing `quicksilver` and pressing enter in the site selection search. Type `flash` + enter to return to normal...
